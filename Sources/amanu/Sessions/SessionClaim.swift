/// The app and `amanu process` are two processes over one recordings folder,
/// and both are meant to be usable at once: the menu bar drains its queue while
/// a person runs the command line on a session by hand. Nothing in the folder
/// said who owned a session, so both could pick up the same one, both upload
/// the same audio to AssemblyAI, and both be charged for it — and then both ask
/// a language model for the same name and the same summary (.issues/004).
///
/// So a claim file, exactly as `.recording.json` marks a folder as being
/// recorded into: dot-prefixed, holding the owner's pid and when it started,
/// and stale-checked by asking whether that pid is still alive. It also carries
/// the `stage`, because the two things worth not paying for twice are the
/// transcript and the post-processing, and a log line reads better saying which
/// one is in progress.
///
/// Unlike the recording marker, this one can genuinely be raced for — two
/// processes may reach for the same folder in the same instant — so it is
/// written whole under a private name and then linked into place, which
/// fails for the loser rather than letting both continue. Taking over a dead
/// owner's claim is the other race, and that one is decided under the
/// session's lock.
