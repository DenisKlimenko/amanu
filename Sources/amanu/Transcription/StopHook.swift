/// The `on_stop` hook: a shell command, given the session folder, run once a
/// session is finished.
///
/// The contract, which is the whole of this type:
///
/// - It fires **once per transcript**, when the session's post-processing has
///   had its pass: names and summary written, or turned off, or given up on,
///   or deferred for want of a model. A summary that arrives on a later sweep
///   does not fire it a second time — a Mac with no model to reach would
///   otherwise never run the hook at all.
/// - It never fires while any amanu — this one or another — is still naming
///   or summarizing the session. Whichever finishes that work fires it: the
///   transcription queue, the sweep at launch and on the network's return,
///   `amanu process`.
/// - With transcription off it fires once the recording has been archived.
/// - A session retired without a transcript does not fire it.
/// - Transcribing a session again owes the hook again.
///
/// It used to fire from the transcription queue the moment post-processing
/// returned — which was also the moment post-processing gave up because
/// another process had the session, so the hook was handed a folder with no
/// names and no summary in it; and a session whose post-processing a later
/// sweep did complete, after a crash or a quit, never fired it at all.
///
/// What is owed is written in meta.json, so that a process that dies
/// between the transcript and the hook leaves the debt for the next one.
/// Sessions recorded before the debt was written down owe nothing, which is
/// what keeps the first sweep after an update from running the hook over
/// every recording on the disk.
