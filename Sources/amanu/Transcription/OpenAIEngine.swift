/// OpenAI's diarizing transcription, over the mixed-down session audio.
///
/// The model is `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`, and it is the only one of
/// OpenAI's transcription models amanu can use: the others return running text
/// with no timings at all, and a transcript with no clock can be neither
/// aligned with the recording nor attributed to a speaker. This one returns
/// segments with start, end and a speaker label — the same shape AssemblyAI
/// returns, which is why both are `.mixed` engines and share everything
/// downstream.
///
/// Two things about the API leak into the code. Requests are capped at 25 MB,
/// which the mix passes at around 55 minutes, so a long meeting is cut into
/// pieces and the timings shifted back onto the session clock; the person who
/// recorded it never hears about any of this. And `chunking_strategy` is
/// required for anything over 30 seconds — the API refuses outright without
/// it, so it is always sent.
///
/// Every response is cached next to the audio (see `ProviderCache`), so a
/// retry after a crash re-renders from disk instead of re-uploading and
/// paying again.
